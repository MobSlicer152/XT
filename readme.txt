This is an operating system modeled after the early design of Windows NT described
in the [NT Design Workbook](ntdesign.txt).

It is not meant to be compatible with Windows NT, but merely to be similar in
design. In theory, however, if I do a good enough job, porting some software
will likely be possible and maybe even easy.

My plan is to implement some basic headers and utility libraries, then the
bootloader, then the kernel, then drivers, then user mode stuff.
